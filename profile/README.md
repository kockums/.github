Kockums Robotics is a cutting-edge company that specializes in the design, development, and deployment of autonomous geospatial robotic systems for a wide set of applications. Our systems are designed to collect, process, and analyze data from various sources, including satellite imagery, aerial photography, marine and ground-based sensors.

Our core product line includes robotic platforms spanneing aerial drones, ground-based vehicles, marine surface and underwater systems. These platforms are equipped with a wide range of sensors and tools, including cameras, lidar, and sonar, to collect data in a variety of environments.

Our robots and drones are equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and mapping technology, allowing them to collect and process large amounts of data in a fast and efficient manner. This data can then be used to create detailed maps, 3D models, and other geospatial information that is used in industries such as construction, mining, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

Our team of engineers and scientists are experts in the field of robotics and have a deep understanding of the geospatial industry. We work closely with our clients to understand their specific needs and tailor our solutions to meet their requirements.

We also offer a variety of data processing and analysis services to help clients make sense of the data collected by our systems. Our team of experts uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to extract valuable information from the data, such as identifying patterns, detecting changes, and creating predictive models.

We believe that geospatial data is crucial for understanding and managing the earth's resources. We are committed to developing innovative technologies and providing high-quality services that make it easier for our clients to access and use this data.

At Kockums Robotics, we are committed to using cutting-edge technology to make the world a better place. We strive to create solutions that are efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.
